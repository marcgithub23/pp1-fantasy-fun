# TESTING

The website was tested on Google Chrome and Safari web browsers to check functionality, responsiveness, and appearance.

## Responsiveness

The website was inspected using devtools to check its responsiveness, for example, the Fanart Gallery page increases in column number as the screen size gets bigger.

Additionally, the website's responsiveness on different devices has been tested using a Google Chrome extension called [Responsive Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb). The following devices were selected for testing:

- Galaxy S9, Note 8, S8 (360 x 740)
- iPhone 6/7/8 Plus (414 x 736)
- iPad (768 x 1024)
- Kindle Fire HDX (800 x 1280)
- Laptop (1280 x 800)

A [pdf](documentation/responsiveness-different-devices.pdf) generated by using a Google Chrome extension called [GoFullPage](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl) is available.

### Lighthouse report

- Lighthouse in devtools checks that the website scores high in performance, accessbility, best practices, and SEO.
- The reponse page has lower accessbility score due to the page being redirected to the home page after 10 seconds. However, it has been tested that 10 seconds is ample time to read the response message at a low reading spead.

## Bugs

### Solved bugs:

- The logo split into two lines on tablet screens. This was solved by editing the menu and logo to fit the header on tablet screens using CSS.
- The logo covered the h2 on Book Club page on tablet screens. This was solved by moving the h2 out of div and putting it under section in the HTML file.
- During the initial HTML validation, the quote sections on each web page and the response section lacked heading. This was solved by adding h2 and hiding it using a CSS style class selector.

### Unsolved bugs:

- There are no known bugs at the time of submission of this project.
