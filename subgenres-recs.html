                <h3><span class="subgenre">High Fantasy</span></h3>
                <p>High fantasy, also known as epic fantasy, is a subgenre of fantasy literature that transports readers
                    to entirely fictional worlds with complex histories, unique cultures, and intricate magic systems.
                    It often features grand, sweeping narratives filled with heroes, villains, and epic quests to save
                    the world. High fantasy worlds are meticulously crafted, and the stories within them explore
                    timeless themes of good vs. evil, heroism, and the struggle for power. These tales are a departure
                    from our reality, offering readers a chance to escape into realms of pure imagination.</p>
                <p>These books showcase the rich storytelling, world-building, and character development that define the
                    high fantasy subgenre:</p>

                <h3><span class="subgenre">Low Fantasy</span></h3>
                <p>Low fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy literature characterised by its connection to the real world or
                    a world that closely resembles our own. Unlike high fantasy, which typically features entirely
                    fictional settings, low fantasy often introduces fantastical elements into a familiar, everyday
                    environment. In low fantasy, the magical and supernatural exist subtly, and the focus is often on
                    how ordinary people interact with or are affected by these elements. This subgenre blurs the lines
                    between reality and fantasy, creating a sense of wonder in the ordinary.</p>
                <p>These titles showcase the diversity of stories that can be told within the low fantasy subgenre,
                    where magic and reality coexist in intriguing ways:</p>

                    of violence, power struggles, and the consequences of one's actions. It's a subgenre that delves
                    into the harsh realities of a fictional world, often with a focus on complex characters and their

                <p>Urban fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy literature set in contemporary, often urban settings, where
                    magical or supernatural elements exist alongside the everyday world. In these stories, characters
                    grapple with magic, mythical creatures, or supernatural forces in modern cities, blurring the lines
                    between the ordinary and the extraordinary. Urban fantasy explores how magic and fantasy can
                    intersect with our familiar, urban landscapes, creating a unique blend of the mundane and the
                    mystical.</p>
                <p>These titles showcase the diverse and imaginative urban settings where magic and the supernatural
                    coexist with the everyday in urban fantasy literature:</p>

                <p>Steampunk fantasy is a subgenre of speculative fiction that combines elements of the Victorian era

                    characterised by its blend of historical settings, retro-futuristic technology, and a strong
                    emphasis on aesthetics and fashion. Steampunk worlds are filled with airships, clockwork
                    contraptions, and a sense of adventure reminiscent of the 19th century, creating a unique and
                    visually rich subgenre.</p>
