        <section id="rules">
            <h2>Book Club Rules:</h2>
            <p>Respectful Discussions: Treat fellow members with respect, even when disagreeing. Engage in
                thoughtful and constructive discussions about the books without personal attacks.</p>
            <p>Stay on Topic: Keep discussions focused on the book and the fantasy genre. While some tangential
                conversation is natural, avoid going too far off-topic.</p>
            <p>Spoiler Etiquette: Be mindful of spoilers. Clearly label discussions with spoiler warnings, and
                avoid revealing major plot twists without warning for those who haven't finished the book.</p>
            <p>Participation: Contribute actively to discussions. Share your thoughts, questions, and insights
                about the book to foster engaging conversations.</p>
            <p>Open-Mindedness: Embrace diverse perspectives. Fantasy is a vast genre with various subgenres and
                themes; be open to exploring different styles and ideas.</p>
            <p>Meeting Commitments: Make an effort to attend regularly and be punctual. Respect the agreed-upon
                meeting times and locations.</p>
            <p>Criticise Constructively: While it's okay to critique aspects of a book, do so constructively.
                Explain why you liked or disliked certain elements, and remember that others may have different
                tastes.</p>
            <p>Maintain a Welcoming Environment: Ensure that the book club remains a welcoming and inclusive
                space for all members, regardless of their backgrounds or opinions. Discriminatory or offensive
                language or behaviour is not tolerated.</p>
            <p>Rotate Book Selection: Share the responsibility of selecting books among members. This ensures a
                variety of reading experiences and prevents one member from dominating the choices.</p>
            <p>Have Fun: Ultimately, the goal is to enjoy reading and discussing fantasy books. Keep a positive
                and enthusiastic attitude, and encourage a sense of camaraderie among members. These rules
                should help create a respectful and enjoyable environment for your fantasy book club. Adjust
                them as needed to fit the specific dynamics and goals of your group.</p>
