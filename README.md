# **FANTASY FUN**

The Fantasy Fun wesbite is for people who wish to dip their toes into the fantasy genre as their first foray, as well as for people who are seasoned readers of the genre but wish to get recommendations for their next read. The website also provides platform for a book club community that like-minded readers can join either online or in-person to discuss and share their love, thoughts, and opinions of books belonging to the genre.
