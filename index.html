            <h2>Why read fantasy?</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Keep your mind wide open</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Fantasy fuels boundless imagination, offering complete creative control without earthly constraints.
                    It
                    invites us into diverse worlds, broadening perspectives. Imagination fosters problem-solving,
                    spurring
                    innovative solutions to complex issues in our ever-evolving world.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Escapism</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Escapism through fantasy is a common and healthy way to temporarily break from reality. It doesn't
                    signify avoidance but offers solace and a break from life's pressures. It enables experiencing
                    unique
                    adventures and fulfilling unattainable dreams, providing a valuable respite.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Lens through which to understand reality</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Fantasy serves as a mirror to reality, offering metaphorical insights into complex issues. It allows
                    us
                    to explore and dissect real-life challenges from a safe, less intimidating distance. Through
                    fantasy, we
                    can glean valuable lessons on topics like governance, teamwork, addressing grievances, and extending
                    a
                    helping hand. It's a tool for reflection and learning.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Empathy</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Characterization and emotional development in fantasy stories create relatability, making readers
                    root
                    for characters despite fantastical settings. Emotions are the bridge to readers' hearts. Fantastical
                    elements can evoke powerful feelings, fostering empathy and healthy emotional coping. Fantasy helps
                    us
                    explore a range of emotions, promoting empathy and a deeper understanding of humanity beneath the
                    magic
                    and dragons. It's a medium for connecting with diverse human experiences.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Beacon of hope</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Fantasy instils hope in the face of adversity, teaching that even epic quests can inspire resilience.
                    It
                    encourages dreaming big, exceeding self-imposed limits, and discovering inner strength to shape our
                    realities. Often underestimated, fantasy imparts invaluable life lessons that extend beyond
                    conventional
                    education. Characters in fantasy serve as powerful teachers, offering insights that would otherwise
                    take
                    a lifetime to acquire through personal experiences. It's a realm of learning as profound as any
                    other.
